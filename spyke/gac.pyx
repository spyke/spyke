"""Nicholas Swindale's gradient ascent clustering (GAC) algorithm, a variant of the
mean-shift algorithm

    TODO:
        - try using cdef inline instead of just cdef to reduce
        a fn's call overhead - think it won't do anything for fn's with numpy array
        args
            - doesn't seem to make any difference, even for purely C arg f'ns. Perhaps
            GCC automatically finds f'ns that are macro candidates and uses them as such?
        
        - reverse annealing sigma: starting small, and gradually increase it over iters
            - increase it a bit every time you get an iteration with no mergers?
        - maybe some way of making sigma dynamic for each scout and for each iteration?
        - maybe annealing of alpha (decreasing it over time)? NVS sounds skeptical

        - classify obvious wide flat areas as noise points that shouldn't be clustered:
            - track the distance each point has travelled during the course of the algorithm.
            When done, plot the distribution of travel distances, and maybe you'll get something
            bimodal, and choose a cutoff travel distance past which any point that travelled
            further is considered a noise point
            - or maybe plot distribution of travel times
            - use some cutoff of local density to specify what's noise and what isn't? skeptical

        - visualize algorithm in real time to see what exactly it's doing, and why some clusters
        are split while others are merged

        - instead of merging the higher indexed scout into the lower indexed one, you should
        really merge the one with the lower density estimate into the one with the higher
        density estimate - otherwise you potentially end up deleting the scout that's closer
        to the local max density, which probably sets you back several iterations
            - this would require calc'ing and storing the density for each cluster, and updating
            it every time it moves
                - is local density and local gradient calc sufficiently similar that this won't
                be expensive?
            - find whichever has the biggest density estimate - if it's not the lowest indexed
            scout (which will be the case 50% of the time), swap the scout's IDs, then
            proceed as usual? Then update the density for the newly merged cluster

        - try using simplex algorithm for scout position update step, though that might miss
        local maxima

        - try using the n nearest neighbours to calculate gradient, instead of a guassian with
        a sigma. This makes it scale free, but NVS says this often results in situations where
        the gradient is 0 for some reason

    DONE:
        - turn off checks for ZeroDivisionError, though I doubt that slows things down much
        - keep track of max movement on each iter, use consistently low max movement as
          automatic exit criteria
            - alternative: keep track of how long it's been since the last scout merger, and
            exit based on that
        - add freezing of points, for speed?
            - when a scout point has moved less than some distance per iteration for all of
            the last n iterations, freeze it. Then, in the position update loop, check for
            frozen scout points
        - add subsampling to reduce initial number of scout points
        - NVS - to weed out potential noise spikes, for each cluster, find the local density
        of the scout point at the max, then reject all other data points in that cluster whose
        ocal density falls below, say, 1% of the max. Apply it as a mask, so you can tweak that
        1% value as you wish, without having to run the whole algorithm all over again
        - delete scouts that have fewer than n points (at any point during iteration?)
        - multithread scout update and assignment of unclustered points step
        - get rid of all 1D temporary numpy arrays. Use alloc() instead
        - rescale all data by sqrt(2)*sigma so you can get rid of the div by twosigma2 operation?
            - only applies to Gaussian kernel, not Cauchy
