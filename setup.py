"""spyke installation script

A "developer" install lets you work on or otherwise update spyke in-place, in whatever
folder you cloned it into with git, while still being able to call `import spyke` and use it
as a library system-wide. This creates an egg-link in your system site-packages or
dist-packages folder to the source code:

$ sudo python setup.py develop

or the equivalent using pip:

$ sudo pip3 install -e .

This will also install a bash script on your system so that you can simply type `spyke` at the
command line to launch it from anywhere.

Other setup.py commands:

For a normal installation (copies files to system site-packages or dist-packages folder):
$ sudo python setup.py install

Build extensions in-place for development:
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Create a source distribution and force tar.gz file:
$ python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar

Create a binary distribution:
$ python setup.py bdist_wininst

NOTE: Make sure there's a MANIFEST.in that includes all the files you want to place
in the tarball. See http://wiki.python.org/moin/DistUtilsTutorial
